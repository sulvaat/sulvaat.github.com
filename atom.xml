    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lets face it, switching audio outputs is a pain on linux. I made a quick script that you can place in /bin to make life easier.</p>

<p>You will need to get asoundconf out of the AUR first, once thats ready to go:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ asoundconf is-active
</span><span class='line'>$ asoundconf list</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sanae@MORIYA&gt; asoundconf list
</span><span class='line'>Names of available soundcards:
</span><span class='line'>Intel 
</span><span class='line'>CODEC // This is my USB DAC</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will print all the cards in your system. Remember them since you will make a script for each one now:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>#!/bin/sh
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>asoundconf is-active
</span><span class='line'>asoundconf list
</span><span class='line'>asoundconf set-default-card Intel</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>#!/bin/sh
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>asoundconf is-active
</span><span class='line'>asoundconf list
</span><span class='line'>asoundconf set-default-card CODEC</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Simple.</p>

<p>Now, move them to /bin so all you need to do is type intel or codec (in this case) to switch.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My laptop decided to kick the bucket last week. The HDD kept making clicks of death, screen flickered whenever the lid moved. Since I can&#8217;t afford to buy a new one and I was starting to miss it
just hours after it had died, it was time to put on the operating gloves and open this baby up!</p>

<p>First thing that needed to be done was a new HDD, I had a spare 250gb drive that fit in nicely. Done. Next was the screen. I peeled off the sticky silicone stoppers around the bezel which revealed
four small screws. As I went about unscrewing them, I found that the top left one had been pre-striped from Chine&#8230;. awesome. After wrestling around with it some more I finally got it; amazing what a
small dab of hairspray can do! The flickering was caused by a few shorts from exposed wire on the ribbon cable. With a soldering iron and a toothbrush, I melted a few of the bristles to seal off the
exposed parts. It smelled like toddler poop for a bit afterwards. Anyway, hit the power and away she went, gave the screen a few swings and all was fine. Yippee!</p>

<p>Now comes the fun part! Since the old HDD was now toast, I had to reinstall the OS on the new drive. Being a tech savvy person, Linux was the obviouse choice. I opted for Archlinux over the
popular debian flavors. I have been working with Arch for the past six months or so and have really come to appreciate it&#8217;s methodologies and it&#8217;s wonderful community. At first, Arch can seem pretty
daunting because there is no default GUI with a pretty setup application. As a fan of BSD, this was not a problem. Just followed the Arch Beginners Guide. All is now well with my laptop!</p>
