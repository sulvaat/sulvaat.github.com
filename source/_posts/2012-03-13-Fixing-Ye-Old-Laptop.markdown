	My laptop decided to kick the bucket last week. The HDD kept making clicks of death, screen flickered whenever the lid moved. Since I can't afford to buy a new one and I was starting to miss it just hours after it had died, it was time to put on the operating gloves and open this baby up!

	First thing that needed to be done was a new HDD, I had a spare 250gb drive that fit in nicely. Done. Next was the screen. I peeled off the sticky silicone stoppers around the bezel which revealed four small screws. As I went about unscrewing them, I found that the top left one had been pre-striped from Chine.... awesome. After wrestling around with it some more I finally got it; amazing what a small dab of hairspray can do! The flickering was caused by a few shorts from exposed wire on the ribbon cable. With a soldering iron and a toothbrush, I melted a few of the bristles to seal off the exposed parts. It smelled like toddler poop for a bit afterwards. Anyway, hit the power and away she went, gave the screen a few swings and all was fine. Yippee!
	
	Now comes the fun part! Since the old HDD was now toast, I had to reinstall the OS on the new drive. Being a tech savvy person, Linux was the obviouse choice. I opted for Archlinux over the popular debian flavors. I have been working with Arch for the past six months or so and have really come to appreciate it's methodologies and it's wonderful community. At first, Arch can seem pretty daunting because there is no default GUI with a pretty setup application. As a fan of BSD, this was not a problem. Just followed the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners%27_Guide">Arch Beginners Guide</a>. All is now well with my laptop!
